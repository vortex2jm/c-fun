# Macro_Templates
 - This implementation show us a way to implement polymorphism in C language.
 - If you have same functions in some data types and you don't wanna create one function for each, you can create only one function that will be used
 as a template for all data types. 

### Instructions
 - To compile files on terminal -> *"make"*
 - To run program -> *"make run"*
 - To remove temporary files -> *"make clean"*
