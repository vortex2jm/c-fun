# Oriented Object Programming implementation in C

 - C language has not OOP, but we can implement it. This code shows how OOP works under the hood.
 - To compile files, type *"make"* on terminal.
 - To run program, type *"make run"* on terminal.
 - To remove temporary files, type *"make clean*" on terminal.

OBS: Main function has 2 classes: "racional" and "matriz_double". These classes inherit "numero" super class attributes and methods. This code show us abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism examples.
